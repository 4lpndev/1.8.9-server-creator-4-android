# 1.8.9-server-creator-4-android
got bored so i made this script to make a 1.8.9 server on android

(note: uses 2gb of ram)

# how to run?
1. open termux
2. type `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4lpndev/1.8.9-server-creator-4-android/main/install.sh | bash` in termux
3. wait
4. it should be installed in less than 10 mins if wifi isn't bad
   
# how to join the server?
1. get your phone's local ip
2. launch minecraft with version 1.8.9
3. connect to x.x.x.x:25565 (where x.x.x.x is your phone's ip)

# how can i make my friends join it?
